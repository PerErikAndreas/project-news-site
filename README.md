# News Site

The assignment is to build and style a newssite and with responsive design make it optimized for computer, tabloid & phone.

## The problem

I approached this task by sketching up the newspage in figjam. My id√©a was to make an imaginary newspage about Nature, Woodindustry, Craftmanship in Alabama. I added pictures from Pexels and made a logo in Inkscape. 

After that I watched and read up on the different elements and tools provided for this task. As I watched and read I also took bits and pieces of code a thought would be sutable for the design I made in Figjam. I figured out that CSS Grid would be the best way to realise my page. As I managed to make me a Grid a filled the boxes with my made up texts and pictures. So far so good, but now it was time to make the Media Quaries. This is were a put most of the time on this project. Trying to place text and pictures exacly where I wanted them was a task.

If I hade more time I would try to make the Grid design in FlexBox instead.
